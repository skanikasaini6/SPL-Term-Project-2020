Milestone 1-

To run the programs go to the individual folders and exectue them using command line with the syntax -
go run programname.go

The reason for seperate files for programs is that go can only have one main class in a single folder and we have made 3 main classes in different files here.

Project Proposal - 
This folder contains the project proposal that gives a brief description about the project.
